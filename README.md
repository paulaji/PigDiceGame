Pig is a classic dice game that has been enjoyed for decades. The game's objective is to score the most points by rolling a six-sided die. It's a game of chance and strategy that can be played with any number of players.

## Game Rules

- Each player takes turns to roll a six-sided die.
- On a player's turn, they can roll the die as many times as they like and accumulate points from each roll.
- If a player rolls a 1, they lose all their accumulated points for that turn, and their turn ends.
- The player can choose to "hold" at any time during their turn, adding their accumulated points to their total score.
- The first player to reach the target score (20, 50, or 100, depending on the chosen mode) or more wins the game.

## Game Modes

Pig Dice Game offers three modes with different target scores:

- **Mode 20**: The target score is 20 points. It's a quick and simple mode, ideal for short games.
- **Mode 50**: The target score is 50 points. This mode provides a balanced gameplay experience for medium-length games.
- **Mode 100**: The target score is 100 points. It offers a longer and more challenging game for those seeking a test of endurance.
